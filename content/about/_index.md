# Prototyping static site generators

The engineering practices guild is trying to formalize some new recommendations for static site frameworks.

We are asking for help evaluating different static site generatorâ€™s prototyping capabilities.

Thank you so much for taking the time to help!

## Project specs:

Create a static site that builds in Cloud.gov Pages with:

- A landing view that includes:
  - the USWDS banner that indicates it is a US government site.
  - A USWDS button link to a form
  - A link to a blog view
- A view with a form that can be submitted
- A form confirmation view that has some javascript elements such as:
  - hiding some div elements based on the form results, or
  - clickable elements that do something
- A blog view with several posts. ([Example](https://18f.gsa.gov/blog/))

This will allow you to evaluate: ease of getting it into production, ease of asset management, ease of incorporating javascript elements in interaction is required by a project.

Examples of prototypes/starters:

- [GSA Small Business Experience Prototype](https://github.com/18F/gsa-small-business-experience)
- [Federalist USWDS Jekyll Starter Project](https://github.com/18F/federalist-uswds-jekyll)
- [Federalist USWDS Gatsby Starter Project](https://github.com/18F/federalist-uswds-gatsby)
- [Federalist USWDS 11ty Starter Project](https://github.com/cloud-gov/11ty-uswds-template) [WIP]

These prototypes should ideally include:

- [An accessibility scan](https://github.com/18F/gsa-small-business-experience/blob/main/.github/workflows/accessibility_scan.yml)
  - If a GitHub Action is too complex for a prototype, incorporate a local accessibility scan
- Multilingual/i18n support
- [HTML Validation/broken link scan](https://engineering.18f.gov/tests/#validating-html-output)
- [An inclusive language scan](https://github.com/get-woke/woke-action)
- A CMS of some sort to allow people without specialized engineering skills to edit static content
  - Please note if this looks possible but too much work for a small prototype
  - Github backed like Netlify CMS or something headless?
- [Asset fingerprinting](https://medium.com/idealo-tech-blog/fingerprinting-and-cloud-storage-or-how-we-became-asset-delivery-champions-bb4aa558b1a6#6535) (currently missing from https://github.com/18F/uswds-jekyll)
  - Also see: [cache busting](https://www.keycdn.com/support/what-is-cache-busting)
- USWDS SCSS processing (not just inclusion of USWDS CSS, but custom theme-ready)
  - Please note [LibSass/NodeSass was deprecated a while back](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated) but is still in common use. Check out DartSass or other SASS/SCSS compilers
- DAP integration
- Search.gov integration
- Other static analysis or vulnerability scans (ie. OWASP Zap)?
- Sitemap & common metadata

Please take notes on whatever is easy, difficult, or notable as you build your prototype!
